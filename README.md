Steering Behaviors for Autonomous Characters

-------------------

OpenSteer is a C++ library to help construct steering behaviors for autonomous characters in games and animation. 
In addition to the library, OpenSteer provides an OpenGL-based application called OpenSteerDemo which 
displays predefined demonstrations of steering behaviors. The user can quickly prototype, visualize, 
annotate and debug new steering behaviors by writing a plug-in for OpenSteerDemo. 

OpenSteer provides a toolkit of steering behaviors, defined in terms of an abstract mobile agent called 
a "vehicle." Sample code is provided, including a simple vehicle implementation and examples of combining 
simple steering behaviors to produce more complex behavior. OpenSteer's classes have been designed to flexibly 
integrate with existing game engines by either layering or inheritance. 

OpenSteerDemo's plug-in framework allows a game AI programmer to quickly prototype behaviors during game 
design, and to develop behaviors before the main game engine is finished. OpenSteerDemo allows the user 
to interactively adjust aspects of the simulation. The user can: start, stop and single step time, select 
the vehicle/ character/ agent of interest, adjust the camera's view and its tracking behavior.

OpenSteer was initially developed by Craig Reynolds beginning in 2002 at the Research and Development 
group of Sony Computer Entertainment America. We wish to acknowledge the support of SCEA, SCEI and 
in particular these executives who had the foresight to release this code as open source for all to 
use: Shin'ichi Okamoto, Masa Chatani and Dominic Mallinson.

After OpenSteer's source code was first released on May 1, 2003 a group of dedicated volunteers 
quickly formed and began to extend the system. Ports to Windows and Mac OS X were contributed within 
24 hours! Today we continue to discuss, test and improve OpenSteer. To contribute, or to just listen in, 
please visit the Open Discussion forum.

Here is a partial list of those who have contributed to OpenSteer, sorted roughly by the amount 
and "freshness" of their contributions: Bjoern Knafla (bknafla), Nick Porcino (meshula), 
Ben Forsyth (bforsyth), Dominik (inikofdoom), Paul (spanneradmin), Kris Hauser (kkhauser), 
Leaf Garland (leaf), Stefan Moises (beffy), Bruce Mitchener (brucem), Maciej Sinilo (yarpen), 
Michael Holm (gizwiz), Richard Cannock (perambulator).  Let us know of any omissions from this list.
